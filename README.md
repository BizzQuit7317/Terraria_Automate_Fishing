**YOU WILL NEED TO REDO THE CORDINATES THERE ALL SETUP FOR MY SPECIFIC MONITOR AND ZOOM**

# Regular
If you have all fish heres a python script to automate the quests for the fishermen

The script works but having the fishermen, 3 chests and a bed all in a line, then you stop the fishermen from moving. The script will then check each chest for the quest fish then sleep for 6 mins. Find below a image of the setup, not the charecter walks left and right for 8 seconds so exact distance dosnt matter, except for the placement of objects eitherside of the walls

If you will also need to use the same bed, andit needs to be in the correct orientation, if you dont have the bed or its not sleeping you can use a different bed and just change the cordinates for the last move and click. 


# Journy mode cheese
For cheesing in journy mode, reasearch all the fish and only the fish to not clutter the tab. just create the setup.
