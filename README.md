# Terraria_Automate_Fishing
If you have all fish heres a python script to automate the quests for the fishermen

The script works but having the fishermen, 3 chests and a bed all in a line, then you stop the fishermen from moving. The script will then check each chest for the quest fish then sleep for 6 mins. Find below a image of the setup, not the charecter walks left and right for 8 seconds so exact distance dosnt matter, except for the placement of objects eitherside of the walls
